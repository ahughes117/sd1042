SD1042 Software Development Exercises

It's a first yeah module, so it's pretty basic, I just upload them to have them collected here and to prevent plaguarism from other students.

Anyone can feel free to take a look though.

Also in the folder special_projects, I have some more advanced object oriented code for some "challenge tasks" described in the UEL's handbook.
